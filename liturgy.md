## A Liturgy to Mark the Start of the Christmas Season
### by Douglas McKelvey

LEADER: Will read normat text, respondents read the bold text.

As we prepare our house for the coming Christmas season,
we would also prepare our hearts for the returning Christ.

**You came once for your people,
O Lord, and you will come for us again.**

Though there was no room at the inn
to receive you upon your first arrival,
**we would prepare you room
here in our hearts
and here in our home,
Lord Christ.**

As we decorate and celebrate, we do so
to mark the memory of your redemptive movement
into our broken world, O God.

Our glittering ornaments and Christmas trees,
our festive carols, our sumptuous feasts—
**by these small tokens we affirm that something amazing
has happened in time and space—**
that God, on a particular night,
in a particular place, so many years ago,
was born to us, an infant King, our Prince of Peace.

Our wreaths and ribbons and colored lights,
our giving of gifts, our parties with friends—
these have never been ends in themselves.
**They are but small ways in which we repeat
that sounding joy first proclaimed by angels
in the skies near Bethlehem.**

In view of such great tidings of love announced
to us, and to all people, how can we not be moved
to praise and celebration in this Christmas season?

**As we decorate our tree, and as we
feast and laugh and sing together,
we are rehearsing our coming joy!
We are making ready to receive the one
who has already, with open arms, received us!
We would prepare you room
here in our hearts
and here in our home,
Lord Christ.**

Now we celebrate your first coming, Immanuel,
even as we long for your return.
**O Prince of Peace, our elder brother,
return soon.
We miss you so!**

**Amen.**
